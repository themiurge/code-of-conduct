Italian C++ Events Attendee Procedure for Incident Handling 
===============================================

If you are an attendee of an event organized by the Italian C++ Community and you are being harassed, notice that
someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please do
the following:

1. **Make sure everyone is physically safe.** If there is a threat to anyone's
physical safety, including yourself, summon security or law enforcement. 
112 is the common emergency telephone number that can be dialed free of charge 
from most mobile telephones and, in some countries, fixed telephones in order to 
reach emergency services (ambulance, fire and rescue, police). The  If you do not have a cell
phone, you can use any venue phone or ask a conference staff member for
assistance. If everyone is physically safe, involve law enforcement or security
only at a victim's request. 

2. **Inform the Code of Conduct conference staff of the incident.** Contact
Marco, Alessandro (info below) and inform him that an incident has
occurred. All conference staff are familiar with the code of conduct and
incident reporting procedure, and can assist you in contacting these
individuals. 

3. **Report the details to the Code of Conduct conference staff.** Provide
Marco, Alessandro with a report describing the incident, preferably by
email. All reports are confidential.

Try to gather as much information as available, but do not interview people
about the incident. The conference staff will assist you in collecting
information and writing the report.

The report should include the following important:

- The name(s) or description(s) of the individual(s) doing the harassing.
- The name(s) or description(s) of any other individual(s) involved in the
    incident.
- The behavior that was in violation.
- The approximate time and location of the incident.
- The circumstances surrounding the incident.

After a report has been made, the conference staff will evaluate and respond to
the incident.
